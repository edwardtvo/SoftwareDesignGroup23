Assignment 1

1. Discuss your initial thoughts in details on how you will design this application? (2 points)


(Edward) All 3 of us joined a call together to discuss all details of Assignment 1. We first discussed picking either Bootstrap or React to build the front end; we will soon choose one to learn and use in preparation for Assignment 2. For potential back end, there might be SQL involved. From our perspective, it is a simple series of screens with different options to navigate to other screens (excluding the inner workings of back end / how fuel quote works). Depending on user inputs or options that the user chooses, the screen will change accordingly (EX: input of correct login information will either lead to the Profile Management screen or the Fuel Quote screen). Details of these navigations will be explained by Henderson and in the UML diagram. The result of our discussion is represented in the attached UML diagram that we worked collaboratively on. 

2. Discuss what development methodology you will use and why? (2 points)


3. Provide high level design / architecture of your solution that you are proposing? (6 points)
